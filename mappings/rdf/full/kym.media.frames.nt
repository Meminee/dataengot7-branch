The phrase is often used to caption image macros where the subject appears to be in mid-rotation or in animated GIFs where the subject is performing a full rotation. It's also commonly used online as a standalone catchphrase in replies or comments to such videos, GIFs and images.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/do-a-barrel-roll> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The barrel roll has been used as an airplane aerial combat technique since dogfighting emerged in 1913 during World War I. However, the barrel roll maneuver was later included as a move in the Super Nintendo console game Star Fox that was released in the U.S. in the spring of 1993. In the game, the player could perform a barrel roll by double-tapping the L and R buttons, protecting the ship from enemy lasers.The specific phrase \"do a barrel roll\" that's referenced in memes comes from the sequel Star Fox 64, released on June 30th, 1997, in which the character Peppy Hare (voiced by Rick May) orders you to \"do a barrel roll!\" while approaching four stationary turrets firing lasers in the game. On June 4th, 2007, YouTuber[9] DeusExBenigma uploaded the earliest known and highest-viewed video of this scene and meme, receiving over 5.9 million views, 32,000 likes and 4,700 comments in roughly 15 years (seen below).".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet> <https://meme4.science/spread> "A set of 50 rules were posted on the text-based 4chan discussion board[14] on February 15th, 2007. The earliest Yahoo! Answers[11] question seeking the original Rules was posted on June 13th, 2007, with the top answer linking to the Encyclopedia Dramatica page. A wiki-style site for the Rules of the Internet[8] was established in December 2007 to document every rule that circulated the web. When the site was first archived[9] in October 2008, 180 rules existed. As of June 2012, the site lists rules numbering in the 900s. In January 2008, a set of 100 rules was added to Urban Dictionary [3]A set of 47 rules exists on an Encyclopedia Dramatica[1] entry as of June 2012. This set also has been documented on the Internet Archive[10] as a community text.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/about> "Emoticons are pictorial representations of facial expressions created with a mix of punctuation marks and letters. They can be used to depict the mood of the author or to influence how the reader interprets the surrounding text. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, emoticons have evolved from simple smiley faces (denoted as :-) ) to compound expressions that consist of characters from other languages and graphical images known as emoji.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/origin> "ASCII Art, or the concept of turning letters and characters into pictures, has been around since at least 1966. However, the earliest known iteration of ASCII-based facial expression is the smiley face (represented as \":-)\" to indicate sarcasm in the preceding statement) as proposed by ARPANET user Kevin MacKenzie[7] via MsgGroup mailing list on April 12th, 1979. The earliest recorded usage of the smiley face has been attributed to a post written by Scott Fahlman, submitted after a three day long discussion[18] on the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general message board about jokes and how to distinguish humor online:Fahlman took credit for inventing the “:-)” and “:-(” emoticons on his website.[8] Decades later, Fahlman stated in an April 2001 interview[9] that he created the smiley to better understand his peers, whose sarcasm on the message board was sometimes misread due to the lack of facial expressions or tone of voice. Meanwhile, the term “Emoticon,” a blending of the words “emotion” and “icon,” appeared in print publications for the first time in the New York Times on January 28th, 1990 and added to the Oxford English Dictionary (shown below) in its June 2001 print edition, followed by the first Urban Dictionary[1] definition submitted on October 1, 2002.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 1990, a series of three dingbat[39] fonts known as Wingdings[40] were incorporated into Microsoft Windows. Though the fonts, which turn letters into glyphs, shapes and small pictures, were not necessarily meant to be used as emoticons, many AOL users used them to decorate their profiles.[41]In the spring of 1991, author David W. Sanderson shared a list of smilies with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who began hosting it on their website.[21] This compilation of 650 emoticons was turned into a book[22] published six years later. In 1992, Internet enthusiast James Marshall also began compiling a list of smilies on his personal website.[12] As of 2008, he had collected 2,231 different smileys. The first book on emoticons, titled Smiley Dictionary: Cool Things to Do with Your Keyboard[23] by author Seth Godin, was published in January 1993.".

The caption \"me gusta\" translates to \"I like it\" in Spanish. In its beginning, the phrase conveyed an odd sense of pleasure in sexually perverse contexts, but the meaning has since broadened to describe a more general state of being disturbed and/or pleased at the same time. The original illustration was created by May Oswald in early 2010.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/me-gusta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The colloquial Spanish phrase \"me gusta\" was first adopted into a Rage Comic drawing by illustrator May Oswald (formerly known as Matt), who uploaded her artwork to 4chan [5] and Reddit [6] on March 18th, 2010. The drawing was also uploaded to her personal Tumblr blog[3] and DeviantART[4] account.During our interview with Oswald on May 6th, 2021, she revealed that the original post to 4chan was a carefully constructed effort to get the meme to go viral, which she did by posting examples of the face in memes from various accounts and IP addresses.[13]The first meme featuring Me Gusta after Oswald's initial post to 4chan used the character in a four-panel comic with a cat reacting to being pet, which Oswald revealed in our interview was actually a meme she made herself (shown below).Oswald eventually revealed herself as the creator of the Me Gusta face in a Reddit thread,[1] as well as an Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread[2] on March 8th, 2011.".

In the decade since its release, it became the subject of widespread mockery among its readers, and has since been widely parodied in minimalist interpretations of the strip's four panels, represented as \"| || || |_\".".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On June 2nd, 2008, Buckley posted a strip titled \"Loss,\"[2] in which the female lead Lilah suffers a miscarriage.

Something Awful users were particularly unkind to the comic, creating mock threads[12][13] (one of which is over 350 pages long), two entire (now closed) wikis and an interactive graph of the comic.[14] Someone went to the extent of making a random CAD comic generator,[15] subtly mocking that even disjointed, mismatched panels of the comic are still funnier than the originals.El Santo[16] (the webcomic overlook), The Bad Webcomic Wiki[17] and others have also mentioned the infamous comic in negative reviews of the webcomic as well. On July 25th, 2009, YouTuber KennylovesArin uploaded a musical tribute based on the comic accompanied by friends Skraggy and Arin (popular animator known as Egoraptor), with lyrical references to the miscarriage strip.".

The face is often used to spam forums and image boards, similar to the Japanese word \"desu\". On 4chan, it has also come to be known as \"Le Lenny Face\" or \"Le Face Face.\"".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/%CD%A1-%CD%9C%CA%96-%CD%A1-lenny-face> <https://meme4.science/origin> "One of the earliest appearances of the emoticon was posted to the Finnish image board Ylilauta[21] at 8:45 a.m. EST on November 18th, 2012. Posted on the site's International board, \"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\" was used as a comment in a thread about whether or not administrators should change the settings on their spam detector. After someone complained about seeing too many posts in stickied threads, an anonymous user used the emoticon and the phrase \"this thread is leaking from the heavens.\" Other users began derailing the thread by posting derivatives of the emoticon with different types of eyes, which continued for three days.".

A screenshot of these bans was also shared on FunnyJunk[6], where it earned 3900 points and gained more than 101,000 views.Redditor Dogcatcher1979 submitted a post titled \"So I guess this is a thing now?\" to the /r/4chan[2] subreddit at approximately 3 p.m. EST, which included a screenshot of the face being used in a 4chan thread (shown below, right). In the post, Redditor 8-bit_d-boy commented that the face resembled the children's television show character Bob the Builder. By 4 p.m. EST, 4chan users had raided the /r/Israel[4] subreddit (shown below, left), with some users referring to the emoticon as \"le Palestine face.\"Also on November 18th, World of Warcraft Forums[5] member Kuallius submitted a post titled \"The Sha of Casuals ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\" and YouTuber cubegoat uploaded a video titled \"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\" (shown below, left). On the following day, cubegoat uploaded another video titled \"Fresh (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) of /b/el Air,\" featuring various animated versions of the emoticon accompanied by the theme song for the 1990's sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (shown below, right). As of November 29th, there are more than 1450 search results for \"(﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\" on YouTube.[20]Over the next several days, various threads with the emoticon popped up on HUPIT Gaming[12], Tech N9ne[13], gun enthusiast forum AR15[14], the IGN Forums[15] and the Facepunch forums[16], among others.

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/about> "Emoticons are pictorial representations of facial expressions created with a mix of punctuation marks and letters. They can be used to depict the mood of the author or to influence how the reader interprets the surrounding text. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, emoticons have evolved from simple smiley faces (denoted as :-) ) to compound expressions that consist of characters from other languages and graphical images known as emoji.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/origin> "ASCII Art, or the concept of turning letters and characters into pictures, has been around since at least 1966. However, the earliest known iteration of ASCII-based facial expression is the smiley face (represented as \":-)\" to indicate sarcasm in the preceding statement) as proposed by ARPANET user Kevin MacKenzie[7] via MsgGroup mailing list on April 12th, 1979. The earliest recorded usage of the smiley face has been attributed to a post written by Scott Fahlman, submitted after a three day long discussion[18] on the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general message board about jokes and how to distinguish humor online:Fahlman took credit for inventing the “:-)” and “:-(” emoticons on his website.[8] Decades later, Fahlman stated in an April 2001 interview[9] that he created the smiley to better understand his peers, whose sarcasm on the message board was sometimes misread due to the lack of facial expressions or tone of voice. Meanwhile, the term “Emoticon,” a blending of the words “emotion” and “icon,” appeared in print publications for the first time in the New York Times on January 28th, 1990 and added to the Oxford English Dictionary (shown below) in its June 2001 print edition, followed by the first Urban Dictionary[1] definition submitted on October 1, 2002.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/emoticons> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 1990, a series of three dingbat[39] fonts known as Wingdings[40] were incorporated into Microsoft Windows. Though the fonts, which turn letters into glyphs, shapes and small pictures, were not necessarily meant to be used as emoticons, many AOL users used them to decorate their profiles.[41]In the spring of 1991, author David W. Sanderson shared a list of smilies with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who began hosting it on their website.[21] This compilation of 650 emoticons was turned into a book[22] published six years later. In 1992, Internet enthusiast James Marshall also began compiling a list of smilies on his personal website.[12] As of 2008, he had collected 2,231 different smileys. The first book on emoticons, titled Smiley Dictionary: Cool Things to Do with Your Keyboard[23] by author Seth Godin, was published in January 1993.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/about> "Slender Man (a.k.a Slenderman) is a mythical creature often depicted as a tall, thin figure wearing a black suit and a blank face. According to the legend, he can stretch or shorten his arms at will and has tentacle-like appendages protruding from his back. Depending on the interpretations of the myth, the creature may cause memory loss, insomnia, paranoia, coughing fits (nicknamed \"slendersickness\"), photograph/video distortions and can teleport at will. The urban legend has inspired fan arts, fictional creepypastas and a mockumentary series in the style of the 1999 indie horror film Blair Witch Project. As the character has grown in popularity, he's gained a number of other nicknames including The Operator, Der Großmann, Mr. Slim, The Administrator, Daddy LongLegs, Mr. Thin, The Tall Man, The Thin Man and Slendy.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/origin> "On June 8th, 2009, a \"'paranormal pictures\" photoshop contest was launched on the Something Awful (SA) Forums.[1] The contest required participants to turn ordinary photographs into creepy-looking images through digital manipulation and then pass them on as authentic photographs on a number of paranormal forums. Something Awful users soon began sharing their faux-paranormal creations with layered images of ghosts and other anomalies, usually accompanied by a fabricated witness account to make them more convincing. On June 10th, SA user Victor Surge (real name Eric Knudsen) posted two black and white photographs of unnamed children with a short description of \"Slender Man\" as a mysterious creature who stalked children.[2]On June 11th, 2009, Victor Surge continued to improve upon the myth by adding another picture and a fake doctor's account.[3] The following day, SA user LeechCode5[4] posted a photograph of a burning building with a Slender Man back story. On June 14th, SA goon TrenchMaul[6] reused the Slender Man character for his own story. The original thread, which still remains active today, extends for 46 pages as of June 2011.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/slender-man> <https://meme4.science/spread> "Slender Man became a well-known mythical creature on the /x/ (paranormal) 4chan board.[7] The earliest known mention of \"Slender Man\" on 4chan can be found in an archived thread dating back to June 24th, 2009, though the conversation suggests that it had been mentioned prior. The image was coupled with hand-drawn illustrations and fanart.Outside of 4chan, Slender Man has caught the attention of several websites including the Unfiction Forums[8], Fangoria[9], Bungie,[10] Facepunch,[11] Wikibin,[12] /x/enopedia,[13] TVTropes,[14] Kongregate,[15] DeviantArt,[16] SlenderNation,[17] and Mythical Creatures Guide.[18]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/about> "An Image Macro is a broad term used to describe captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message or a catchphrase. On discussion forums and imageboards, image macros can be also used to convey feelings or reactions towards another member of the community, similar to it predecessor emoticons. It is one of the most prevalent forms of internet memes.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/origin> "The earliest captioned images were made by American photographer Harry Whitter Frees[1] in 1905. The picture consisted of a photograph of a cat dressed in a robe sitting on a chair and a caption that says: \"What's Delaying My Dinner?\" It is also considered the prototype of LOLcats that became immensely popular a century later.The term \"image macro\" was first coined in Something Awful[2] in 2004. In the forums, users could summon a number of default image macros using simple commands like [img – macro], for example, timelines, \"Aces!\" and \"Captain Obvious to the Rescue!\" images. The name is derived from the computer scientific definition of a macro: a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined procedure. The earliest definition of an image macro was submitted by SomethingAwful forum user Eclipse[3] on February 12th, 2004.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/image-macros> <https://meme4.science/spread> "In 2005, the term \"image macro\" spread across a number of other forums and imageboards, most notably on 4chan [4] where the medium of image macros took on a life of its own. The popularity of image macros in the anonymous community culminated with the birth of LOLcats circa June 2006. While the scope of the term was initially limited to describing images captioned in bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline, its working definition eventually expanded to describe images with superimposed text.Beginning in 2007, numerous websites such as I Can Has Cheezburger [5]and MemeGenerator[6] were launched to allow users to easily create image macros. The text is usually in a bold Impact font with white letters and a black outline. With the mainstream exposure of 4chan and development of image macro subgenres in the late 2000s, the term has been increasingly referenced in the news media outside of Internet communities as well.".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Navy Seal Copypasta (also known as the “Marine Copypasta”, \"Internet Tough Guy Copypasta” and “Gorilla Warfare Copypasta”) is a facetious message containing a series of ridiculous claims and grandiose threats that portray the poster as an Internet tough guy stereotype. In the original post, the writer claimed to be a former Navy Seal with a long history of combat experiences, using comical typos and hyperboles like \"Gorilla Warfare,\" “300 Confirmed Kills” and “I can kill you in over 700 ways with just my bare hands.” Since its emergence in mid-2012, the copypasta has spawned a variety of spin-off stories, similar to the John Copypasta meme.".

The earliest archived posting was submitted on November 11th, 2010 to 4chan's /jp/[4] (Otaku Culture) board, in which the poster claimed to have seen the message previously on Operator Chan.On May 24th, 2012, an anonymous user submitted a thread to the /pasta/[1] board, claiming he had created the original copypasta two to three years prior (shown below).[2]".

<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/about> "Creepypasta is a popular subgenre of copypasta which consists of short horror fictions and urban legends mainly distributed through word of mouth via online message boards or e-mail. In recent years, some authors have re-appropriated the genre into an effective pretext for bait-and-switch trolling.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "While folklores have been an essential part of cultural traditions for many centuries, the term \"urban legend\" began appearing in print publications as early as 1968 and became widespread through a series of books written by English professor Jan Harold Brunvand in the early 1980s. Since then, the word has become closely associated with short horror or mystery stories set in modern day. Starting in the 1990s, chain letter e-mails quickly emerged as the primary medium for sharing such stories on the Internet. [1]The Internet slang term \"creepypasta,\" which is derived from copypasta, did not enter the 4chan community's vernacular until mid-2007, with the earliest known archived thread[2] dating back to July 6th.".

Try Creepypasta, or Web Scares\"[11] was published on November 12th, 2010. A Facebook[13] fan page has 9,277 likes as of October 28th, 2011. Creepypasta archives can be found on various sites including Creepypasta.com[9], the Creepypasta Wiki[10], Tumblr[6], the SCP Foundation[7], and Microhorror.[5]".

The term is an English portmanteau of \"copy,\" \"paste\" and \"pasta.\" Although it shares some characteristics with spam in the sense they're both unsolicited (and often considered a nuisance), copypastas are mainly spread through human operators whereas the latter is automatically generated by electronic messaging systems.".
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta> <https://meme4.science/origin> "This simple concept of \"manually copying text from one place and pasting it elsewhere\" has been in practice since the innovation of basic text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of \"cut and paste\" commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing software.[1]The origin of the term \"copypasta\" is unknown; although, some report to seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April 20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, \"An amount of lengthy text that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to an irrelevant subject.\" The post received more than 170 upvotes in less than 15 years (shown below).".
